basic understanding
Linear regression is a commonly used technique in machine learning for various tasks, including:

Prediction: Linear regression can be used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

Relationship Analysis: Linear regression helps in understanding the relationship between variables and can be used to quantify the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable. It helps in identifying which features are more influential in predicting the target variable.

Feature Engineering: Linear regression can be used as a tool for feature engineering. By fitting a linear regression model to the data, you can identify the weights or coefficients assigned to each feature, which can be used to rank or select the most important features for other machine learning algorithms.

Assumption Checking: Linear regression provides insights into the linearity assumption between variables. It can help identify any non-linear relationships, outliers, or violations of assumptions that may need to be addressed before applying more complex models.

Baseline Model: Linear regression can serve as a baseline model for more sophisticated algorithms. It provides a simple and interpretable model that can be used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other models.

Anomaly Detection: Linear regression can be used for anomaly detection by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. Unusual deviations between the predicted and actual values may indicate the presence of anomalies or outliers.

It's worth noting that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. If the relationship is non-linear, other regression techniques like polynomial regression, decision trees, or neural networks may be more appropriate.
